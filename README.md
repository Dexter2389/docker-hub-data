Software Engineering Trends on Docker Hub
=========================================

An end-to-end framework which help the company to predict software engineering trends and the developers to know more about a docker image.

Our goal is to provide different companies with a dynamic dataset through which meaningful inferences can be made.

Under the mentorship of Nandhini from Docker, our aim is to gather data from Docker Hub and analyse the trends. Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository in which Docker users and partners create, test, store and distribute container images.

# Contents
1. "Data" - This folder contains all the data related files and folders that are generated or are stored for later use. This is also the folder where all the 'plots' generated by ```analysis.ipynb``` and another scripts.
2. "Misc" - Contains all the miscellaneous scripts that are required for this project.
3. "Models" - 
4. "Scripts" - This folder is the main folder. This contains all the scripts that we used to scrape the data, clean that data, select required data to do analysis, and finally do analysis on the data and derive inference from the data.
